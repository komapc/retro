---

## Phase 0 — Pre-Start (Before Month 1)

These must be done before the clock starts on salaries.

### Legal & Corporate
- [ ] Choose company structure (Ltd. in Israel — *Chevra Bet* is standard for tech startups)
- [ ] Engage startup-focused Israeli lawyer (referral from accelerator network or F6S)
- [ ] Incorporate: ~1–2 weeks, ~₪8,000–12,000 all-in
- [ ] Open business bank account (Leumi Tech or Discount startup tracks)
- [ ] Draft founder agreement: equity split, vesting schedule (4 years, 1-year cliff)
- [ ] Assign IP to company (critical before any investor conversation)

### Hiring
- [ ] Write job description for mathematician / data engineer
- [ ] Post on: LinkedIn, Facebook ML Israel group, JobMaster, academic ML dept boards (TAU, Technion, Hebrew U, BGU)
- [ ] Target profile: probability theory background + Python/LightGBM/scikit-learn + interest in forecasting
- [ ] **Start date: Month 4** — recruit in Phase 0 and Months 1–2, but salary clock starts Month 4
- [ ] Consider part-time consulting arrangement in Months 2–3 (feature design only, low cost) before full hire

---

## Month 1 — Pipeline Repair & Foundation

**Theme: Fix the data gap. Nothing else matters until cells are filling.**

### Pipeline (Priority 1)
The current pipeline has an 83% "no predictions" rate (218/264 cells). Root causes to diagnose and fix:

- [ ] Audit `no_predictions` cells: are articles being fetched at all, or fetched but empty?
- [ ] Fix CDX scan: increase `CDX_SCAN_LIMIT` (currently 150) and `CDX_FETCH_LIMIT` (currently 15) for historical queries
- [ ] Haaretz: test Wayback snapshot quality; if consistently paywalled, subscribe to Haaretz digital archive (~$150/mo)
- [ ] Globes / Calcalist: identify if paywall is blocking Wayback snapshots; add direct subscription if needed
- [ ] Reuters: low `done` rate despite being a major source — investigate URL pattern issues in CDX
- [ ] Add per-cell diagnostic logging: distinguish "no articles found" vs "articles found but gatekeeper rejected all"
- [ ] Fix the 5 `failed` cells (JSON parse errors from Gemini) — add retry with stricter prompt

### Matrix Definition
- [ ] Define the canonical list of 200 Middle East events (event taxonomy: war, elections, diplomatic, economic, terror incidents)
- [ ] Define the canonical list of 100 sources (Israeli Hebrew, Israeli English, Arabic, Turkish, international wire)
- [ ] Identify which ~20 sources need paid access — subscribe to those before retro fill begins
- [ ] Confirm date range: 5 years back = 2021–2026; extend to 7 years (2019–2026) if CDX coverage allows at no extra cost

### Translation Pipeline
- [ ] Integrate Google Translate API into `gnews_ingest.py` for Arabic and Turkish sources
- [ ] Add language detection (langdetect library) before translation call to avoid billing for already-English content
- [ ] Test on 3 Arabic sources + 2 Turkish sources

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up separate AWS environments: `dev` and `prod`
- [ ] Enable AWS Cost Explorer alerts at $200/mo and $500/mo thresholds
- [ ] Set up pipeline monitoring: failed cell alerts via email/Telegram

### Deliverable: end of Month 1
- Pipeline filling cells at >50% rate (down from 17% currently)
- 200 events + 100 sources defined and locked
- Mathematician/data engineer hired and onboarded

---

## Month 2 — Retro Fill Begins + TruthMachine Design

**Theme: Get data flowing. Mathematician designs the model architecture.**

### Retro Fill
- [ ] Begin systematic retro fill: run pipeline on full 100×200 grid, 2021–2026
- [ ] Process in batches by year: start with 2024–2025 (freshest CDX coverage), then go backward
- [ ] Target: 5,000+ cells with predictions by end of month (25% of matrix)
- [ ] Monitor translation costs weekly — pause and optimize if Google Translate spend exceeds $500 in first run

### TruthMachine — R&D Phase
The mathematician/data engineer leads this track. Existing prototype: `backtest.py` uses `lgb.LGBMClassifier`.

- [ ] Audit existing `backtest.py`: understand current feature set, label definition, train/test split
- [ ] Define the prediction target formally: what exactly is TruthMachine predicting? (probability that a claim resolves true, given source stance scores + metadata)
- [ ] Design feature matrix:
  - Stance scores (mean, variance, skew across sources)
  - Source authority weights
  - Sentiment + certainty + hedge_ratio from extractor
  - Time horizon, prediction type
  - Cross-source agreement/disagreement signals
  - Polymarket baseline (where available)
- [ ] Identify minimum viable training set size: how many labeled (claim → outcome) pairs are needed?
- [ ] Map existing Polymarket data (`polymarket.py`) to resolved events — this is the ground truth source

### Legal
- [ ] App privacy policy + Terms of Service drafted (covers data collection, prediction disclaimers)
- [ ] GDPR-light compliance review (Israeli Privacy Law 5741 + EU users if any)
- [ ] Review top 5 source ToS for scraping/extraction legality — flag any red lines

### Daatan Forecast — Spec
- [ ] Write product spec: what does the app show? (event list, source comparison, forecast probability, historical accuracy)
- [ ] Design Android app wireframes
- [ ] Define data API: what endpoints does the app need from the backend?

### Deliverable: end of Month 2
- 5,000+ cells filled
- TruthMachine feature spec finalized
- App wireframes approved
- Legal foundation complete

---

- [ ] QA spot-check: human review of 200 random extracted predictions for accuracy
- [ ] Fix any systematic extraction errors found in QA

### TruthMachine — Alpha
- [ ] Assemble training dataset: join extracted predictions with Polymarket resolved outcomes
- [ ] Minimum target: 500 labeled examples (claim + features → binary outcome)
- [ ] Train first LightGBM model on available data
- [ ] Evaluate: Brier score, calibration curve, feature importance
- [ ] Iterate: add/remove features based on importance; retrain
- [ ] Document model card: what the model predicts, training data, known limitations

### Daatan Forecast — Android Development
- [ ] Set up Android project (Kotlin + Jetpack Compose)
- [ ] Google Play Developer account ($25 one-time)
- [ ] Backend API: FastAPI or Flask serving pre-computed forecast data
- [ ] Screen 1: Event list with forecast probability badges
- [ ] Screen 2: Event detail — source breakdown, TruthMachine score, historical chart
- [ ] Auth: simple email/password or Google Sign-In

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up production database (RDS PostgreSQL) for forecast data
- [ ] Set up S3 bucket for pre-computed results
- [ ] Automate weekly pipeline re-run for new events (cron)

### Deliverable: end of Month 3
- 10,000 cells filled (50% retro complete)
- TruthMachine alpha: Brier score baseline established
- Android app: 2 core screens working against real data

---

## Month 4 — Retro Fill 80% + Model Integration + App Beta

**Theme: Connect everything. Internal testing.**

### Retro Fill
- [ ] Push to 16,000+ cells (80%) — cover 2019–2021 (older CDX, expect lower coverage)
- [ ] Identify structural gaps: events with <5 sources covered — flag for manual archive research
- [ ] Handle Arabic/Turkish gaps: if Google Translate quality is poor for certain source styles, add post-translation cleanup

### TruthMachine — Beta Model
- [ ] Retrain on expanded dataset (now ~2,000+ labeled examples as retro fill grows)
- [ ] Add cross-validation: 5-fold CV to check for overfitting
- [ ] Tune hyperparameters: LightGBM num_leaves, learning_rate, min_data_in_leaf
- [ ] Integrate model into backend API: `/api/forecast/{event_id}` returns TruthMachine score
- [ ] Calibration: apply isotonic regression or Platt scaling to output probabilities

### Daatan Forecast — Beta
- [ ] Internal beta: founders + 10–20 trusted testers (journalists, analysts)
- [ ] Collect feedback: UI clarity, trust in forecasts, missing features
- [ ] Performance: ensure app loads in <2 seconds for any event
- [ ] Push notifications: alert users when a forecast changes by >10 points
- [ ] Android widget (optional stretch goal for virality)

### Content Access
- [ ] Review Wayback coverage for 2019–2021 — if gaps are critical, evaluate Factiva or LexisNexis trial access
- [ ] Finalize content budget: if paid archive spend is tracking above $5,000, reprioritize sources

### Deliverable: end of Month 4
- 80% retro matrix complete
- TruthMachine beta: calibrated model in production
- Android app beta: tested by 20+ users
- All legal docs live on app store listing

---
